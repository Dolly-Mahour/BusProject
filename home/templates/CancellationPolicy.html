    <p>At Busify, we understand that travel plans can change. Our Cancellation Policy is designed to be transparent and
        fair to all our users. You can cancel your bus ticket bookings through our website or app, provided the
        cancellation is made before the cut-off time set by the respective bus operator. Each operator may have
        different rules regarding cancellation windows and refund eligibility, which will be displayed at the time of
        booking.</p><br>
    <p>Cancellation charges may apply as per the operator’s policy, and Busify may charge a small processing fee in some
        cases. Refunds for eligible cancellations will be processed back to your original payment method within 5–7
        business days, depending on your bank or payment provider.</p><br>
    <p>Please note that last-minute cancellations, no-shows, or missed buses due to personal delays may not be eligible
        for any refund. Busify will not be responsible for cancellations caused by unforeseen events such as natural
        disasters, strikes, or operator-specific issues, though we will do our best to assist you.</p><br>
    <p>By booking through Busify, you acknowledge and agree to this Cancellation Policy. For any questions or support
        with cancellations, please contact our customer service at busify@gmail.com.</p>
